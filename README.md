# BPG-400_Driver
The Infinicon BPG-400 is a dual Pirani/Bayard-Alpert vacuum gauge that supports 1000 mbar - 5E-10 mbar of measurement range.  
Automatic switching between elements is handled, and both an analog (0,10)V log and digital output is provided. This driver aims to simplify the implementation of the gauge while using the RS232 interface.  
  
## RS232
A standard RS232 interface at 9600 baud 8N1 is used to communicate with the gauge.
